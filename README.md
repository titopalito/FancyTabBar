FancyTabBar is a simple menu button that expands to reveal up to 5 sub-menu options. It's a great way to keep your interface uncluttered.

We currently use it in our prototyping iPhone app,  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marvel-app/id765801658?mt=8"> check it out on the app store </a>

Hope you find it useful!
